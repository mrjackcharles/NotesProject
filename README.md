Description of how it works:
This is a flask application build using primarily python code. This app also includes html for the webpage formatting. It also has one javascript file for the deletion of notes. A dockerfile is used within the application to build it as well as a docker-compose file to deploy the app. 
The formatting of the webiste uses several bootstap links in base.html in order to create a satisfiying UI.
